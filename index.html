# Intro to Docker

---

## Hi, I'm .okay[Calvin Rodo].

--

## I'm a .okay[Senior Advisor] in Application Development at Employement and Social Development Canada.

--

## I'm also the .okay[Digital Fellow] for .okay[DevOps] with the Digital Academy.

---

## .okay[What] is Docker

--

### Docker is a combination of a .okay[Container], a .okay[Container Registry], and a .okay[Daemon] that runs containers on an OS.


---

## What is a .okay[Container]?

--

### A container is a way to create .okay[immutable] infrastructure it packages up the configuration, files, and state of an application into an .okay[image] that can be moved around.

--

### .whoah[Important Note:] You can think of it like a VM but it's important to note that it is not a VM. 


--

## Docker containers are called .okay[images] they are .okay[built] from .okay[Dockerfiles]

???

Containers share the underlying operating system and while under normal use a the processes in a container are isolated from other containers on a system but if someone was to break out of a container they would be able to access other processes on that OS.

I'll explain these terms later

---

## What is a .okay[Container Registry]?

--

### A place where you can get .okay[images] that other people have created and where you can store your own.

--

### https://hub.docker.com is Docker's "official" registry

---

## What is a .okay[Daemon]?

--

### A .okay[Daemon] is just a process that runs in the background on a machine all the time and has no gui.

### For those from the windows side of things it's identical to a windows service

## .okay[Why] would you use Docker?

---

## .okay[Reusability]

--

### .okay[Dockerfile] are just text

--

### .okay[Images] consist of .okay[layers]

--

### Dockerfiles can .okay[extend] other Images

???

So that means they can be stored in source control and treated the same way as code.
You can automate the creation of images from dockerfiles, you can automate quality checks, you can collaborate using modern ALM tools like git, github, gitlab etc..

Because images have the concept of layers and the Dockerfile that defines an image allows you to extend other images, you can create common container definitions that can be extended by other people in your organization.
Or you can take advantage of images built by existing organizations that already have fully configured software. 

---

## .okay[Immutability]

--

### No more "Works on my machine!"

--

### No more patching only replacing!

???

With containers you can be confident that the container that runs on your machine is identical to the one running on the server. 
No more patch windows, or wondering what version of software you are running, just rebuild a container and replace the old one. 

---

## .okay[Introspection]

--

### You can apply .okay[Metadata] to containers
### https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/annotations.md

--

### You can use .okay[docker diff] to compare two images

???

The ability to apply metadata to images and to compare two images allows novels ways to interact with your servers
Use labels to figure out who built things where they were built, whatever you want. 

---

## .okay[Repeatability]

--

### Infrastructure as Code

???

As mentioned earlier because dockerfiles are just text and they are the steps in createing an image you can reliably recreate your image over and over again. 

---

## .okay[Simplicity]

--

### Processes think they are alone in a container

--

### Smaller attack surface

???

Everything can host http on port 80

You can mess around with the OS without worrying about breaking other peoples stuff 

Always have the version of files you want without overriding others stuff.

Less stuff to hack inside the container

---

# Important things to remember!

--

## Containers don't contain!

--

## Security of the underlying OS is still important

--

## Security is still .whoah[important]!

---

## What's you should dive into next.

---

## Container orchestration

### Using tools like Kuberenetes you can run your programmatically connect containers together and scale horizontally as needed. 

???

High-level overview of kubernetes

---

## Cloud tools

###  The cloud is where containers really start to .okay[shine]

???

explain some of the stuff in the cloud here
